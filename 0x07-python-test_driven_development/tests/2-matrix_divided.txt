How to use matrix_divided function in module 2-matrix_divided.py

matrix_divided(matrix, div) => matrix every element in matrix with div

Usage:

::
	>>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [
	...     [3, 6, 9],
	...     [12, 15, 18]
        ... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

::

Test Cases:

1) Invalid matrices:

if matrix is not a list

::

	>>> matrix = "not a matrix"
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

::

	>>> matrix = None
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

Notice an empty matrix will raise an exception

::

	>>> matrix = []
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

But an empty list of list will not raise exception

::

	>>> matrix = [[]]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	[[]]

::

When the matrix contains not ints and not floats

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, "not a number", 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

Finally testing if the rows are of the same size

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3, 4],
    ...     [5, 6, 7]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

::


2) Testing for divisors

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, "not a number")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

::

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

::

Finall testing for zero division

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
